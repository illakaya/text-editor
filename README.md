# Just Another Text Editor

## Description

This project was constructed in order to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Application (PWA) criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. The application was built from starter code and implements methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database using a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. Through this project, I learnt about:

- Lighthouse
- Webpack bundles, loaders and plugins
- Service workers and Inject Manifests
- Caching
- IndexedDB

The image below shows the application on Render and as a PWA.
